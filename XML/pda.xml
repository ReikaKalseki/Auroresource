		Ancient Metallic Meteorite
	</name>
	<pda>
		A slightly buried several-thousand-year-old impactor, containing high concentrations of metal ores, including metallic elements not commonly found on planetary surfaces. The amount of material in this body is sufficiently large that it is for all intents and purposes infinite from the perspective of a single inhabitant.
		
		Analysis: Potential inexhaustible supply of various metals for construction purposes, and source of trace minerals for specialized fabrication

		Lava Dome
	</name>
	<pda>
		A large upwelling of semisolid magma from deep underground. While the material is dangerously hot, the differential cooling rates of the constituent minerals in the magma frequently results in the accumulation of crystalline deposits of various materials. Due to the volcanic activity in this region, these materials are being continuously replenished, and as such this resource supply cannot be depleted.
		
		Analysis: Likely renewable supply of various crystalline materials
